Solar Energy Analysis Project

Overview

This project analyzes the solar energy potential across three West African countries: Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo. By examining key metrics such as Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI), and Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI), the project aims to provide insights that can guide solar energy development and investment decisions in the region.

Task 2: Data Profiling, Cleaning and EDA

Project Description:

This repository contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebooks for conducted on three datasets extracted from Solar Radiation Measurement Data.

Datasets:

benin-malanville.csv

sierraleone-bumbuna.csv

togo-dapaong_qc.csv

All cleaned dataset have been exported:

cleaned_benin_data.csv

cleaned_sierra_data.csv

cleaned_togo_data.csv

Task 3: Cross-Country Comparison

The project uses datasets that contain solar radiation measurements for Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo. The key metrics analyzed include:

Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI): Total solar radiation received on a horizontal surface.
Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI): Solar radiation received directly from the sun.
Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI): Solar radiation received from the sky, excluding direct sunlight.

Analysis

The analysis includes:

Summary statistics for GHI, DNI, and DHI by country.
Visualizations such as bar charts and box plots to illustrate solar energy potential.
Recommendations based on the findings to guide future solar energy projects.

Folder and File Overview:

notebooks/ - contains three EDA notebooks that explore different aspects of the dataset. - It also contains compare_countries notebooks that compares solar radiation across the 3 countries
